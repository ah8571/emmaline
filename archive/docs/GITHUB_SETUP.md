# GitHub Setup Instructions

## ✅ Repository Ready for Upload

Your local repository has been initialized and committed. Now you need to:

### Step 1: Create Empty Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `emmaline`
3. Description: `Emmaline - AI Phone Call Buddy for Multitasking`
4. Select **Public**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote (Already Done)
Remote has been added locally:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/ah8571/emmaline.git
git branch -M main
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
Once the empty repository exists on GitHub, run:

```powershell
cd "C:\path\to\emmaline"
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Email Configuration
Your git config is already using `ah8571@github.com` which is safe for public repos.
✅ All commits are associated with your GitHub account, not personal email

## 📋 Commit Details
- **Commit Hash**: Will be generated on push
- **Files Committed**: 48 files
